# Photo gallery
View my photography! 

I want to share my photography with the world. I will create a gallery using project management, iterative devlopment,
and feedback from my friends. 

#Project Milestones 
<li> Create a layout for the project: reuse the css layout I created from bootstrap </li>
<li> Make sure that the layout is responsive: it has drag and drop capability, along with navigation collapse at the
right hand side </li>
<li> Test in all browsers but IE: figure a quick way to do this instead of manually </li>
<li> Make sure that the layout works on mobile devices </li>
<li> Allow a zoom on the images</li>
<li> Allow a display for the camera specs</li>

#Project Scope 
<i> Figure out a hosting site for the images because the loading on the hosting site is too slow</i>
<i> Figure out a better hosting site!</i>
<i> Use Imgur as a host site</i>
